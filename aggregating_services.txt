The Plan for aggregating services.

We can do this in two places:

(1) backend
In the backend, we can create a service that calls "other services" and abstracts out the data sets


(2) Client Side
The Express route encapsulates the call to the gateway upstream url.  Given this, we can have the
Express route call multiple gateway upstream URLs and package the data for the Angular service.
